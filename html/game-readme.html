                <p>This game is an unfinished work in progress. It breaks once the player is prompted to pick items. I originally made it as a fun side project in order to learn more about web development about 6-7 months ago.
                <br>
                <p>I never actually got it to work, and by the time that I decided to fix it, I realized that the code I had made was too jumbled for me to reasonably edit and organize.</p> 
                <p>However, I wanted to include it because I put a lot of detail in how the game is supposed to unfold! There is a large amount of dialogue, and I tried to add a trick to beat the game that isn't simply attacking every turn. I made sure to include a number of food references so that the player would realize what the trick is. </p>
